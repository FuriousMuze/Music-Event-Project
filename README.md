trello: https://trello.com/b/ZFzOEsaR/music-event-project

Technologies Used:
Bootstrap, better-errors gem.

Approach Taken: 
I created the 3 necessary models/controllers for venue, user and event. What this did was allow me the use of relationships to activate the tables that would grant use to them.
